This is Prompt 1 for English 230, "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (Fall 2021), at the University of Victoria. 

Responses to the prompt should be submitted via the course Brightspace. Thanks! 

*Written on Monday, September 13th*

The first two weeks of this course focus on defining media, including the treatment of media as materials, labour and techniques, social practices, embodied experiences, and culture and values. The third week (Sept. 21, 22, and 24) then applies this treatment to specific methods for studying media in contemporary fiction. This prompt asks you begin practicing those methods. 

The prompt's primary aim is for you to articulate (or combine) the "comprehension" and "apprehension" of media in fiction, and you're welcome to respond to the prompt in one of three ways. (Just pick one, tho.)
