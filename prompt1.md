## Prompt 1

*Written on Monday, September 13th*

The first two weeks (Sept. 8 - 17) of this course focus on defining media. The third week (Sept. 21 - 24) then applies this definition to methods for studying media in contemporary fiction. This prompt asks you to begin practicing those methods. 

The prompt's primary aim is for you to articulate (or combine) the "comprehension" and "apprehension" of media in fiction, and you're welcome to respond to the prompt in one of three ways. (Just pick one, tho.)
