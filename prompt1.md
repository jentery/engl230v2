This is Prompt 1 for English 230, "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (Fall 2021), at the University of Victoria. 

Responses to the prompt should be submitted via the course Brightspace. Thanks! 

## Prompt 1

*Written on Monday, September 13th*

The first two weeks (Sept. 8 - 17) of this course focus on defining media. The third week (Sept. 21 - 24) is about methods for studying what media do in fiction. This prompt asks you to begin practicing those methods. 

The prompt's primary aim is for you to articulate (or combine) the "comprehension" and "apprehension" of media in fiction. You're welcome to respond to the prompt in **one** of three ways.

### The Three Options 

**Option 1, "Mood and Main Content"**: This option appeals primarily to studies of feeling and storytelling. Write two detailed paragraphs (totaling about 500 words, plus up to three image, audio, or video files) that describe the *mood* and *main content* of Kittaka's *Secrets Agent*, YHCHI's *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*, or Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle." Your two paragraphs should give your audience a palpable sense of how the work's feel or vibe intersects with its story. After these two paragraphs, please include a one- or two-sentence critical observation you would make about the work you selected based on your description of its mood and main content. 

**Option 2, "Modes and Modules"**: This option appeals mostly to studies of artistic media. Write two detailed paragraphs (totaling about 500 words, plus up to three image, audio, or video files) that describe the *modes* and *modules* of Kittaka's *Secrets Agent*, YHCHI's *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*, or Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle." Your two paragraphs should give your audience a clear picture of how the work's various parts address or engage your senses. After these two paragraphs, please include a one- or two-sentence critical observation you would make about the work you selected based on your description of its modes and modules. 

**Option 3: "Materials and Moment"**: This option appeals mostly to studies of media history and culture. Write two detailed paragraphs (totaling about 500 words, plus up to three image, audio, or video files) that describe the *materials* and *moment* of Kittaka's *Secrets Agent*, YHCHI's *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*, or Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle." Your two paragraphs should give your audience a clear sense of how the physical substance of the work corresponds with the context of when, where, by whom, and for whom it was made. After these two paragraphs, please include a one- or two-sentence critical observation you would make about the work you selected based on your description of its materials and moment. 

## Tips for Writing 

* This response is not an essay. Think of it as an exercise in developing an idea or argument.   
* Pick only one work  (*Secrets*, *M00D*, or "Message"), focus on it, and read / watch / play it multiple times. Take notes and document your experience as you go. 
* Stick to thorough and detailed descriptions in your first two paragraphs. You don't need to analyze, review, or evaluate the work. Just describe, describe, describe. Imagine communicating with someone who is unfamiliar with the work. Which details would you share to help them picture it? 
* Feel free to include alongside your writing up to *three* image, audio, and/or video files that convey your experience of the work and/or provide evidence of the work's content. Here, you might consider screen capture techniques and/or reaction videos as two (among many) possibilities. If you've never used screen capture techniques, then feel free to email me for assistance. (This goes for any technical stuff in the course, btw.)
* If you do include audio, image, or video files in your response, then be sure to reference them in your writing. Try, for example: "See the attached file, which is . . ." or "The example below is a . . ."
* Option 3: "Materials and Moment" is the only response that should require additional (internet) research, mostly because you'll be contextualizing the work. Feel free to link to online materials to help your audience follow that context. 
* Writing the observation at the end may be the toughest part of the response. A compelling critical observation typically acknowledges a particular interpretation of a work, communicates another (different or new) interpretation, and then says why and for whom that new or different interpretation matters. Consider this logic, which you're welcome to replicate, test, or revise for the sake of practice: "While some people may say that 'Work X' is 'Interpretation A', it also 'Interpretation B'. This aspect of 'Work X' matters to 'Community Y' because 'Reason C.'"
* The language of "mood," "main content," "modes," "modules," "materials," and "moment" will be further explained during lecture on Tuesday, September 21st. If you'd like to get started now, then I've provided some guiding questions at the bottom of the document.
