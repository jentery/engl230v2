## Prompt 1

*Written on Monday, September 13th*

The first two weeks (Sept. 8 - 17) of this course focus on defining media. The third week (Sept. 21 - 24) is about methods for studying what media do in fiction. This prompt asks you to begin practicing those methods. 

The prompt's primary aim is for you to articulate (or combine) the "comprehension" and "apprehension" of media in fiction. You're welcome to respond to the prompt in **one** of three ways.

### The Three Options 

**Option 1, "Mood and Main Content"**: This option appeals primarily to studies of feeling and storytelling. Write two detailed paragraphs (totaling about 500 words, plus up to three image, audio, or video files) that describe the *mood* and *main content* of Kittaka's *Secrets Agent*, YHCHI's *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*, or Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle." Your two paragraphs should give your audience a palpable sense of how the work's feel or vibe intersects with its story. After these two paragraphs, please include a one- or two-sentence critical observation you would make about the work you selected.

**Option 2, "Modes and Modules"**: This option appeals mostly to studies of artistic media. Write two detailed paragraphs (totaling about 500 words, plus up to three image, audio, or video files) that describe the *modes* and *modules* of Kittaka's *Secrets Agent*, YHCHI's *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*, or Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle." Your two paragraphs should give your audience a clear picture of how the work's various parts address or engage your senses. After these two paragraphs, please include a one- or two-sentence critical observation you would make about the work you selected.

**Option 3: "Materials and Moment"**: This option appeals mostly to studies of media history and culture. Write two detailed paragraphs (totaling about 500 words, plus up to three image, audio, or video files) that describe the *materials* and *moment* of Kittaka's *Secrets Agent*, YHCHI's *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*, or Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle." Your two paragraphs should give your audience a clear sense of how the physical substance of the work corresponds with the context of when, where, by whom, and for whom it was made. After these two paragraphs, please include a one- or two-sentence critical observation you would make about the work you selected.
