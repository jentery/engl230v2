This is Prompt 1 for English 230, "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (Fall 2021), at the University of Victoria. 

Responses to the prompt should be submitted via the course Brightspace. Thanks! 

## Prompt 1

*Written on Monday, September 13th*

The first two weeks (Sept. 8 - 17) of this course focus on defining media. The third week (Sept. 21 - 24) is about methods for studying what media do in fiction. This prompt asks you to begin practicing those methods. 

The prompt's primary aim is for you to articulate (or combine) the "comprehension" and "apprehension" of media in fiction. You're welcome to respond to the prompt in **one** of three ways.

### The Three Options 

**Option 1, "Mood and Main Content"**: This option appeals primarily to studies of feeling and storytelling. Write two detailed paragraphs (totaling about 500 words, plus up to three image, audio, or video files) that describe the *mood* and *main content* of Kittaka's *Secrets Agent*, YHCHI's *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*, or Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle." Your two paragraphs should give your audience a palpable sense of how the work's feel or vibe intersects with its story. After these two paragraphs, please include a one- or two-sentence critical observation you would make about the work you selected based on your description of its mood and main content. 

**Option 2, "Modes and Modules"**: This option appeals mostly to studies of artistic media. Write two detailed paragraphs (totaling about 500 words, plus up to three image, audio, or video files) that describe the *modes* and *modules* of Kittaka's *Secrets Agent*, YHCHI's *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*, or Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle." Your two paragraphs should give your audience a clear picture of how the work's various parts address or engage your senses. After these two paragraphs, please include a one- or two-sentence critical observation you would make about the work you selected based on your description of its modes and modules. 

**Option 3: "Materials and Moment"**: This option appeals mostly to studies of media history and culture. Write two detailed paragraphs (totaling about 500 words, plus up to three image, audio, or video files) that describe the *materials* and *moment* of Kittaka's *Secrets Agent*, YHCHI's *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT*, or Hopkinson's "Message in a Bottle." Your two paragraphs should give your audience a clear sense of how the physical substance of the work corresponds with the context of when, where, by whom, and for whom it was made. After these two paragraphs, please include a one- or two-sentence critical observation you would make about the work you selected based on your description of its materials and moment. 

## Tips for Writing 

* This response is not an essay. Think of it as an exercise in developing an idea or argument.   
* Pick only one work  (*Secrets*, *M00D*, or "Message"), focus on it, and read / watch / play it multiple times. Take notes and document your experience as you go. 
* Stick to thorough and detailed descriptions in your first two paragraphs. You don't need to analyze, review, or evaluate the work. Just describe, describe, describe. Imagine communicating with someone who is unfamiliar with the work. Which details would you share to help them picture it? 
* Feel free to include alongside your writing up to *three* image, audio, and/or video files that convey your experience of the work and/or provide evidence of the work's content. Here, you might consider screen capture techniques and/or reaction videos as two (among many) possibilities. If you've never used screen capture techniques, then feel free to email me for assistance. (This goes for any technical stuff in the course, btw.)
* If you do include audio, image, or video files in your response, then be sure to reference them in your writing. Try, for example: "See the attached file, which is . . ." or "The example below is a . . ." Avoid dropping media files into a response without introducing them. 
* Option 3: "Materials and Moment" is the only response that should require additional (internet) research, mostly because you'll be contextualizing the work. Are you curious about short free games (like *Secrets Agent*) made with Construct 2, animations (like *M00D*) made with Flash, or short sci-fi (like "Message") published by PM Press? Then try a few searches and include in your writing some links to relevant online materials. 
* Writing the observation at the end may be the toughest part of this response. A compelling critical observation typically acknowledges a common interpretation of a work, communicates another (different or new) interpretation, and then says why and for whom that new or different interpretation matters. Consider this logic, which you're welcome to replicate, test, or revise for the sake of practice: "While some people may say that 'Work X' is 'Interpretation A', it is also 'Interpretation B'. This aspect of 'Work X' matters to 'Community Y' because 'Reason C.'" Here is an example: "While some people may say that *THE M00D 0F THE M0MENT* is the sort of work that would only appeal to critics, it is also having some fun with critics at their expense. This aspect of *M00D* matters for media artists because its plays with assumptions that art should always be "deep" or mean something." 
* The language of "mood," "main content," "modes," "modules," "materials," and "moment" in the three options above will be further explained during lecture on Tuesday, September 21st. If you'd like to get started now, then I've provided some guiding questions at the bottom of the document.

## Assessment 

I will assess your response to Prompt 1 based on the following criteria: 

* Engagement with the prompt (25%): how well and to what degree it responds to the prompt 
* Thoroughness of detail (25%): the degree to which the work (*Secrets*, *M00D*, or "Message") is described through attention to details and evidence 
* Quality of description (25%): not just the quantity of detail and evidence, but the degree to which descriptions of the work are informative or demonstrative, especially for people who may be unfamiliar with it
* Potential of critical observation (25%): the degree to which the observation could spark an engaging or compelling line of inquiry (an idea or argument) about the work that follows from its description 

You will receive a mark for each of the four criterion, which will be tallied (.25 x 4) to result in your mark for Prompt 1. I will send feedback to you via Brightspace. I will use [UVic's grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) for assessment, according to this rubric: "exceeds and raises expectations" (A+), "exceeds expectations" (A, A-), "exceeds some expectations" (B+), "meets expectations" (B, B-), "meets some expectations" (C+, C), "meets few expectations" (D), and "no submission." You will have an opportunity to revise your response to Prompt 1, 2, or 3 by Friday, December 3rd. This revision can only improve your mark. 

## What to Submit 

You may submit your response to Prompt 1 via Brightspace as a PDF, DOCX, RTF, or HTML file containing 500 - 600 words, excluding an MLA-style Works Cited page, which should include any works you reference, even if you only reference one work (*Secrets*, *M00D*, or "Message"). 

If you decide to include media files alongside your writing, then feel free to attach them as separate JPG (image), PNG (image), TIFF (image), MP3 (audio), WAV (audio), MP4 (video), MOV (video), or PDF (document) files in Brightspace. Alternatively, you may import them into your PDF, DOCX, RTF, or HTML document and display them there. This way, you need to submit only one document.   

## When to Submit It 

Please submit your response via Brightspace by Friday, September 24th at 10:30am.
