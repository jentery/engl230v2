# Description 

How do we not only *read* fiction but also *see*, *watch*, *play*, and *listen* to it? This course engages that very question by attending to what audio, images, and text do in 21st-century fiction. We'll consider numerous formats along the way: comics, podcasts, games, animation, short fiction, and more. You'll learn how to write about media and fiction for a critical audience and to integrate a range of sensory modalities into your own interpretive process. The course materials will assume you've no previous experience with media studies or media arts. 

Please note: "media" in the title implies "audio, images, and text," not news or communication outlets ("the media"). 

# Aims 

In this course, you'll learn to:

* Develop a vocabulary for approaching media in the context of fiction.  
* Interpret what audio, images, and text do in fiction. We'll practice various techniques for watching, reading, playing, and listening to the stories people make with media. 
* Communicate critically with audio, images, and text. You'll have opportunities to practice composing across these media, with an informed audience in mind. 
* Use media as evidence in arguments and criticism. You will, for instance, integrate audio, images, and even video alongside quotations in your writing about fiction.

Each of these four outcomes should apply to work across disciplines and occupations, regardless of your major at UVic. They are useful whenever you're interpreting media or writing for the web.

# About Us 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him / his). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” I spend 12.67% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about prototypes and experimental fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to VCU for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from UW. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses in English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT) and direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca). 

And my name is Madyson Huck (she / her / hers). I am a graduate student interested in Victorian periodicals, the digital humanities, and all things literary theory. I am a settler originally from Calgary, which is located on the traditional territories of the people of the Treaty 7 region in Southern Alberta. Through the course of this semester, I aim to leverage the skills from my BAs in English and Psychology, and my 5+ years of experience in the fields of mental health and leadership consulting, to support your learning. You are welcome to contact me via email with questions, or if you are eager for in-person conversation, please know I am happy to chat before / after our scheduled sessions, too.

# Assignments

We're back to campus during COVID-19. These are complex and overwhelming times, so we'll try to keep this course as simple as possible. 

We're asking you to complete two types of assignments this term:

* **Written responses to four prompts** (each 20% of your final mark): You'll respond (individually, outside of class time) briefly to four prompts through a combination of audio, images, and text. The prompts will ask you to examine assigned materials, with attention to detail, from a critical perspective. Each response will constitute 20% of your final mark, and you'll have an opportunity to revise one of your first three responses to improve your grade. All four responses will be assessed based on rubrics provided in the prompts themselves, and you will submit each of them via Brightspace. (Please do not submit them via email or in print.)  
* **Eight worksheets** (totaling 20% of your final mark): You'll complete (in small groups, during class time) a series of worksheets that will address the foundations of media and literary studies. These exercises will be assessed somewhat generously based on a scale of "exceeds expectations," "meets expectations," "meets most expectations," "meets some expectations," "incomplete," and "not submitted." The worksheets will be marked in two bundles of four, and each bundle will constitute 10% of your final mark (for a total of 20%).  

There are no research papers, quizzes, presentations, or discussion forums in this course. There are no exams, either. Your fourth response to a prompt (submitted via Brightspace) will serve as your final exam in this course.  

This approach to assignments means you'll need to submit something to Brightspace only four times this term (or five, if you revise). The worksheets will be circulated, completed, and submitted during class time (usually on Fridays). We hope this strategy will help us all to avoid feeling (less) overwhelmed this Fall. 

As for scheduling, you will know 40% of your final mark by Friday, October 17th; 70% by Tuesday, November 16th; and 80% by Wednesday, December 8th, before the final response to a prompt is due (on Tuesday, December 14th). And again, if you want to improve your mark, you'll have the opportunity to revise one response of your choice by Friday, December 3rd. (Your mark can only improve with revision.)

Due dates for the assignments are provided in the schedule below, the prompts will be available in Brightspace, and worksheets will be distributed (in print) during class meetings. 

# Structure

We'll meet three days a week (TWF). A typical week will include a lecture on Tuesday, a large group discussion about a work of fiction on Wednesday, and, on Friday, a small group workshop on foundations, from interpreting media in the context of fiction to writing critically about media. Detailed lecture notes will be provided in Teams for the purposes of accessibility and group discussion. If the notes are insufficient for the sake of access, then we will audio- or video-record lectures and discussions. Feedback on this approach is welcome from you along the way. 

For details about what we will discuss and when, see the schedule below or visit the course Brightspace.

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that **we'll opt for care in every instance.** If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, or we need to return to zoomrooms, then we'll cut materials, including assignments. We've planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

We suggest dedicating 3 to 5 hours of study each week to this course, plus 3 hours for weekly meetings (TWF). To frame expectations and decrease overwork, we assign in the schedule (see below) a number of recommended hours to each week of the course. We should note that 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.

In Brightspace, we will also message you once each week with an update on how the course is progressing and what you may wish to consider as we move forward (to plan for reading, assignments, due dates, and whatnot).  

# Materials  

Here's a list of works ("assigned texts") we'll study in the course. You need to purchase only the first one (Bechdel's *Fun Home*). The rest are available either online (public) or in Brightspace (private to the class). 

* The graphic novel and memoir, [*Fun Home*](http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/bechdel/) (2006), by Alison Bechdel 
* The collection of comics, [*Killing and Dying*](https://drawnandquarterly.com/killing-and-dying) (2015; excerpts), by Adrian Tomine    
* The speculative fictions, ["Message in a Bottle"](https://tachyonpublications.com/product/falling-love-hominids/) (2004), by Nalo Hopkinson, and [*The Fifth Season*](https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-fifth-season/) (2015; excerpts), by N.K. Jemisin  
* Experimental fiction such as [*With Those We Love Alive*](http://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=with-those-we-love-alive) (2014), by Porpentine Charity Heartscape and Brenda Neotenomie, and [*THE M00D OF THE MOMENT*](https://www.yhchang.com/THE_MOOD_OF_THE_MOMENT_V.html) (2007), by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries
* The animated short film, [*Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWjnYKyiUB8) (2018), by Amanda Strong and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson 
* The role-playing game, [*Undertale*](https://undertale.com/) (2015), by Toby Fox and Temmie Chang

* The dramatic podcast, [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires) (2016), by Jeffrey Cranor, Janina Matthewson, and Mary Epworth 

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material, or some of it will become optional. 

We're also providing you with a "notebook" on contemporary media and fiction that will document material from lectures and discussions to, again, render that material, and what we're doing in class, as accessible as possible. The notebook will be circulated as a Word doc via Teams, and we will invite you to comment, converse, and ask questions in the margins. 

To reiterate, then: the only text we're asking you to purchase is a copy of Bechdel's *Fun Home* (print or ebook), which is available at the [UVic Bookstore](https://www.uvicbookstore.ca/text/book/9780618871711?course_id=10001). It's $25 new and $19 used. 

You do not need to purchase any software for this course; however, you'll need access to the internet and a computer. We will use Brightspace and Teams, both provided by UVic. We will also use Zoom for office hours as well as appointments outside of class.
