# Description 

How do we not only *read* fiction but also *see*, *watch*, *play*, and *listen* to it? This course engages that very question by attending to what audio, images, and text do in works from the 21st century. We'll consider numerous formats along the way: comics, podcasts, games, animation, short fiction, and more. You'll learn how to write about media and fiction for a critical audience and to integrate a range of sensory modalities into your own interpretive process. The course materials will assume you've no previous experience with media studies or media arts. 

Please note: "media" in the title implies "audio, images, and text," not news or communication outlets ("the media").
