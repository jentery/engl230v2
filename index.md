# Description 

How do we not only *read* fiction but also *see*, *watch*, *play*, and *listen* to it? This course engages that very question by attending to what audio, images, and text do in works from the 21st century. We'll consider numerous formats along the way: comics, podcasts, games, animation, short fiction, and more. You'll learn how to write about media and fiction for a critical audience and to integrate a range of sensory modalities into your own interpretive process. The course materials will assume you've no previous experience with media studies or media arts. 

Please note: "media" in the title implies "audio, images, and text," not news or communication outlets ("the media"). 

# Aims 

The intended learning outcomes of this course are for you to: 

* Develop a vocabulary for approaching media in the context of fiction.  
* Interpret what audio, images, and text do in fiction. We'll practice various techniques for watching, reading, playing, and listening to the stories people make with media. 
* Communicate critically with audio, images, and text. You'll have opportunities to practice composing across these media, with an informed audience in mind. 
* Use media as evidence in arguments and criticism. You will, for instance, integrate audio, images, and even video alongside quotations in your writing about fiction.

Each of these four outcomes should apply to work across disciplines and occupations, regardless of your major at UVic. They are useful whenever you're analyzing media or writing for the web.

# About Us 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him / his). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” I spend 12.67% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about prototypes and experimental fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to VCU for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from UW. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses in English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT) and direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca). 

And my name is Madyson Huck (she / her / hers). I am a graduate student interested in Victorian periodicals, the digital humanities, and all things literary theory. I am a settler originally from Calgary, which is located on the traditional territories of the people of the Treaty 7 region in Southern Alberta. Through the course of this semester, I aim to leverage the skills from my BAs in English and Psychology, and my 5+ years of experience in the fields of mental health and leadership consulting, to support your learning. You are welcome to contact me via email with questions, or if you are eager for in-person conversation, please know I am happy to chat before / after our scheduled sessions, too.
