This is the revisions prompt for English 230, "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (Fall 2021), at the University of Victoria. It is also available in [PDF](promptRevision.pdf). 

Responses to the prompt should be submitted via the course Brightspace. Thanks! 

## Revisions 

*Written on Tuesday, November 23rd*

A response to this prompt is *optional*. It encourages you to revise your response to Prompt 1, 2, *or* 3. If you revise, then your mark for the response can only go up.

## Instructions 

1. Please pick one (and only one) of your first three responses that you wish to revise. 
2. Review the feedback you received. 
3. Email us any questions you have about the feedback and/or attend a revision workshop on November 25th or December 2nd, 11am - 12pm. (See us for the zoom URL.)
4. Make a plan for revisions. 
5. Now revise the response to address the feedback and to also make any other changes you'd like to see in your work. If you are revising a word processing document (such as something written in Microsoft Word or Google Docs), then please enable "track changes."
6. Next, in another document, please use 75-150 words to outline the changes you made. I'll use this document to guide my re-assessment of your work. 
7. Submit your revised document(s) as well as your outline of revisions (again, 75-150 words) via Brightspace. 

During revisions, you are welcome to exceed the word count by up to 20% of the original count (e.g., responses to Prompt 1 may be up to 600 words).  

## Assessment 

I will assess your revisions based on the criteria detailed in the original prompt. 

Your mark for the response can only improve if you revise it. There will be no penalty for revisions. 

## What to Submit 

A response to this prompt is optional. 

Submit your revised document(s) as well as your outline of revisions (again, 75-150 words) via Brightspace. You are welcome to revise material in any format, from a word document to an audio file to an image or video file. If you revise a word document, then please enable track changes. Thanks! 

## When to Submit It 

Please submit your revisions by Friday, December 3rd at 10:30am. I am unable to mark revisions submitted after Wednesday, December 8th.
