This is an FAQ for undergraduate students in English 230, "Contemporary Media and Fiction" (Fall 2021), at the University of Victoria. 

The [syllabus](https://jentery.github.io/engl230v2/) for the course is now available online, and the course Brightspace will be ready by Wednesday, September 8th. English 230 will meet TWF, 10:30-11:20am. 

## What Will We Study? 

We'll examine what audio, images, and text do in 21st-century fiction: how we *read* fiction but also *see*, *play*, *watch*, and *listen* to it. We'll consider numerous formats along the way: comics, podcasts, games, animation, short fiction, and more.

Here's a list of what's on the schedule:

* The graphic novel and memoir, [*Fun Home*](http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/bechdel/) (2006), by Alison Bechdel 
* The collection of comics, [*Killing and Dying*](https://drawnandquarterly.com/killing-and-dying) (2015; excerpts), by Adrian Tomine    
* The speculative fictions, ["Message in a Bottle"](https://tachyonpublications.com/product/falling-love-hominids/) (2004), by Nalo Hopkinson, and [*The Fifth Season*](https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-fifth-season/) (2015; excerpts), by N.K. Jemisin  
* Experimental fiction such as [*With Those We Love Alive*](http://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=with-those-we-love-alive) (2014), by Porpentine Charity Heartscape and Brenda Neotenomie, and [*THE M00D OF THE MOMENT*](https://www.yhchang.com/THE_MOOD_OF_THE_MOMENT_V.html) (2007), by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries
* The animated short film, [*Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWjnYKyiUB8) (2018), by Amanda Strong and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson 
* The role-playing game, [*Undertale*](https://undertale.com/) (2015), by Toby Fox and Temmie Chang
* The platforming game, [*Celeste*](http://www.celestegame.com/) (2018), by Extremely Ok
* The first-person game, [*Gone Home*](https://gonehome.game/) (2013), by the Fullbright Company 
* The adventure puzzle game, [*Secrets Agent*](https://even-kei.itch.io/secrets-agent) (2014), by Marina Kittaka 
* The dramatic podcast, [*Within the Wires*](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/withinthewires) (2016), by Jeffrey Cranor, Janina Matthewson, and Mary Epworth 

If this ends up being too much for the term, then we'll cut material, or some of it will be optional. 

## What Do We Need to Purchase? 

The only book we're asking you to purchase is Bechdel's *Fun Home* (print or ebook), which is available at the [UVic Bookstore](https://www.uvicbookstore.ca/text/book/9780618871711?course_id=10001). It's $25 new and $19 used. 

All other materials will be available either online (public) or via Brightspace (private to the class). To increase accessibility and ease of use, we will share detailed lecture notes with you as well. 

You do not need to purchase any software for this course; however, you'll need access to the internet and a computer. We will use Brightspace and Teams, both provided by UVic. We will also use Zoom for office hours and appointments outside of class.

## What Will We Learn? 

You'll learn to: 

* Develop a vocabulary for approaching media in the context of fiction.  
* Interpret what audio, images, and text do in fiction. We'll practice various techniques for watching, reading, playing, and listening to the stories people make with media. 
* Communicate critically with audio, images, and text. You'll have opportunities to practice composing across these media, with an informed audience in mind. 
* Use media as evidence in arguments and criticism. You will, for instance, integrate audio, images, and even video alongside quotations in your writing about fiction.

## What Are the Assignments? 

We're back to campus during COVID-19. A lot is happening right now, so we're going to keep it simple to avoid feeling (more) overwhelmed.  

We're asking you to complete two series of assignments this term:

We're asking you to complete two types of assignments this term:

* **Written responses to four prompts** (each 20% of your final mark): You'll respond (individually, outside of class time) briefly to four prompts through a combination of audio, images, and text. The prompts will ask you to examine assigned materials, with attention to detail, from a critical perspective. Each response will constitute 20% of your final mark, and you'll have an opportunity to revise one of your first three responses to improve your grade. All four responses will be assessed based on rubrics provided in the prompts themselves, and you will submit each of them via Brightspace. (Please do not submit them via email or in print.)  
* **Eight worksheets** (totaling 20% of your final mark): You'll complete (in small groups, during class time) a series of worksheets that will address the foundations of media and literary studies. These exercises will be assessed somewhat generously based on a scale of "exceeds expectations," "meets expectations," "meets most expectations," "meets some expectations," "incomplete," and "not submitted." The worksheets will be marked in two bundles of four, and each bundle will constitute 10% of your final mark (for a total of 20%).  

There are no research papers, quizzes, presentations, or discussion forums in this course. There are no exams, either.

This approach to assignments means you'll need to submit something to Brightspace only four times this term (or five, if you revise).

## What's the Workload Like? 

The most important thing to know about this course is that **we'll opt for care in every instance.** If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, or we need to return to zoomrooms, then we'll cut materials, including assignments. 

We suggest dedicating 3 to 5 hours of study each week to this course, plus 3 hours for weekly meetings (TWF). To frame expectations and decrease overwork, we assign in the schedule a number of recommended hours to each week of the course.

## What Will We Do in Class? 

We'll meet three days a week (TWF). A typical week will include a lecture on Tuesday, a large group discussion about a work of fiction on Wednesday, and, on Friday, a small group workshop on foundations, from interpreting media in the context of fiction to writing critically about media. Detailed lecture notes will be provided in Teams for the purposes of accessibility and group discussion. 

## Is The Syllabus Available? 

It is, indeed! [Check it out](index.html). We've included due dates for everything as well as brief descriptions of what you should expect each class session.  

## Will There Be a Course Brightspace? 

There will be! Look for it on September 8th (when we'll first meet). 

## How Many of Us Will There Be? 

Probably 62: 60 students plus us two (Jentery and Madyson) 

## We're Studying Games? What If I Cannot or Do Not Want to Play Them?  

We've selected a few indie games to interpret and discuss. They are available across platforms, such as Itch, which is DRM-free. If you'd rather not purchase or play them, then you're welcome to watch no-commentary gameplay videos of them. 

You'll access other formats (including podcasts, animations, and interactive fiction) online, and you can read *Fun Home* in print or on an e-reader.

We'll study samples of the assigned works during class. Those sessions will involve combinations of reading, looking, watching, listening, talking, playing . . . 

## Who Are You? 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him / his). I skip a syllable and say it in two: “JEN-tree.” I spend 12.67% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about prototypes and experimental fiction. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to VCU for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from UW. I've been at UVic, on lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ territories, since 2011. I teach courses in English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT) and direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca). 

And my name is Madyson Huck (she / her / hers). I am a graduate student interested in Victorian periodicals, the digital humanities, and all things literary theory. I am a settler originally from Calgary, which is located on the traditional territories of the people of the Treaty 7 region in Southern Alberta. Through the course of this semester, I aim to leverage the skills from my BAs in English and Psychology, and my 5+ years of experience in the fields of mental health and leadership consulting, to support your learning. You are welcome to contact me via email with questions, or if you are eager for in-person conversation, please know I am happy to chat before / after our scheduled sessions, too.

## I Have Questions. 

Please email them to me (Jentery), and I'll address them. I'm at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca). I realize we're all juggling a lot (and are likely a bit nervous or anxious) right now. So don't hesitate to drop a line with any concerns you have. I'm happy to help.

See you soon! We're looking forward to working with you this term.
